# PokemonPerlaBot
A Bot Programmed to Play Pokemon Perla. At this current stage, the bot saves the game, and walks the player from left to right, pressing the A Button before and after each walk-cycle. If the switch-variable is set to `True`, then the bot switches the positions of the first and second Pok√©mon in the party. Currently, PerlaBot works well for grinding. Written in Python.

It should also be noted that PerlaBot has a "failsafe" method programmed in; if you move your mouse to the upper-left corner of your computer screen, the programme will automatically stop.
## Dependencies
PerlaBot requires [PyAutoGUI](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui), which can be installed using pip:
```
pip install pyautogui
```
For Mac OSX, PyAutoGUI requires the modules [pyobjc-core](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc-core) and [pyobjc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc).

For Linux distributions, PyAutoGUI requires either [python3-xlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python3-xlib) (for Python 3) or [python-xlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-xlib) (for Python 2).

Emulator controls should be set as follows:

Computer Key | Gameboy Equivalent
--- | ---
X key | A button
Z key | B button
Enter/Return key | Start button
Up key | Up
Down key | Down
Left key | Left
Right key | Right

## Usage
PerlaBot may be activated as following:
```
python perla.py maxRunTime WaitTime SwitchVariable
```
(NOTE: the `maxRunTime` and `WaitTime` variables are in minutes, while the `SwitchVariable` is a boolean value)

## Example
```
python perla.py 20 1 True
```
In this example, the bot runs for 20 minutes after a one minute waiting period. Additionally, because the switch variable is set to `True`, the first and second Pokemon in your party are switched.
